Android-Ambit
#############

The goal of this repo is to provide a tool to communicate with an 
Ambit(ambitlib) based Suunto Watch.

Current status:
- Detect a hardcoded device and request permission
- System launches App when device is connected

TODO:
- port ambitlib and use natively, or rewrite it into Java (my 
preference, tbd)
- first milestone: read device info and logbook

# Building

This project depends on melogsta and android-cardui (in my repos)
